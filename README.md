The images depict output data from a computational model displaying various Nash Equilibria and the associated strategies of attackers and defenders. Here's a suggested README format to describe these images and their context effectively:

# Nash Equilibria Visualizations

## Overview
This repository contains visualizations of Nash Equilibria derived from simulations of cyber-defense scenarios. Each image represents different equilibrium states where neither the attacker nor the defender can unilaterally deviate to improve their payoff without the other party also changing their strategy.

## Files
- `Equilibrium1.png`: Displays the first Nash Equilibrium where the attacker fully commits to one strategy while the defender fully commits to another.
- `Equilibrium2.png`: Displays the second Nash Equilibrium with roles and strategies switched from the first.
- `Equilibrium3.png`: Illustrates a mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium where both attacker and defender randomize their actions.

## Description
- **Equilibrium 1 and 2:**
  - Attacker's Strategy: `[1.0, 0.0]` or `[0.1]` indicating a complete focus on a single line of attack.
  - Defender's Strategy: `[0.1]` or `[1.0, 0.0]` indicating a dedicated defense against a specific threat.

- **Equilibrium 3:**
  - Attacker's Strategy: `[0.5, 0.5]` showing a balanced approach between two strategies.
  - Defender's Strategy: `[0.5, 0.5]` mirroring the attacker's balanced strategy.

These images and data serve as a visual aid for understanding strategic interactions in cybersecurity and game theory. They demonstrate how optimal strategies can vary based on different assumptions and models.
